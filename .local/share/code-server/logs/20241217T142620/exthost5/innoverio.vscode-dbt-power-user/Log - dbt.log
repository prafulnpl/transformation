It is strongly advised to enable `require_certificate_validation` flag or explicitly set `cert` configuration to `True` for security reasons. You may receive an error after that if your SSL setup is incorrect.
You may opt into the new behavior sooner by setting `flags.require_certificate_validation` to `True` in `dbt_project.yml`.
